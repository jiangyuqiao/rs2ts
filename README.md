# rs2ts

(Work In Progress)

A semi-automatic tool to help transforming Rust code to TypeScript code.

## Getting started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install all dependencies `pnpm install`.
3. Run `pnpm build` for the final minimized version. Run `pnpm watch` for incremental builds.
4. Run `pnpm start` to start a simple static webserver.
